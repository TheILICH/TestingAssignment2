Safari BrowserStack Tests

MAIN KEYWORDS EXPLAINED

Open Browser: Opens Safari browser on BrowserStack cloud servers (macOS) using 
remote_url. This connects to BrowserStack instead of local Safari.

Wait Until Element Is Visible: Waits up to specified seconds (e.g., 15s) 
for an element to appear on page before continuing. Prevents clicking 
elements that haven't loaded yet.

Execute Javascript: Runs JavaScript commands directly in the browser. 
More reliable than regular clicks for some websites. Example: 
document.querySelector('#login2').click() finds element by ID and clicks it.

Input Text / Input Password: Types text into input fields. Password variant 
hides what you type (shows dots instead of characters).

Handle Alert: Deals with JavaScript popup boxes. ACCEPT clicks the OK button.

Close All Browsers: Closes all open browser windows and ends BrowserStack session.
